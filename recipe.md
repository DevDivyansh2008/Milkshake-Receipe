Step 1: Add the Milk, Ice Cream and Mix-Ins
Send your ingredients straight to the blender. For best results, put in your milk first. That will get the blender mixing quickly. Be sure to let your ice cream soften before scooping. If it’s too hard, you might end up having to add more milk, which thins the shake. We’re going to make a strawberry shake, so we’ll add 1/2 cup frozen unsweetened strawberries and 1 tablespoon strawberry preserves.
Step 2: Blend ’til smooth
It’s time to blend away. You’ll want to keep an eye on the consistency. This recipe creates a Goldilocks-style shake: not too firm and not too runny. Of course, the perfect consistency is totally up to your preference. Use less milk for a thicker, spoonable shake; more for a thinner, sippable one.
Step 3: Pour and Enjoy!
Pour your milkshake into a chilled glass to serve
